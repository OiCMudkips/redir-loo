# (In-progress, Not completed)

redir-loo is a Node.js web application which allows users to use their University Waterloo [Central Authentication Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Authentication_Service) (CAS) credentials to login and create redirects which can only be resolved by other other people who are logged in with CAS.

This is backed by MariaDB due to the fact that that [Nearly Free Speech](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/)'s hosting supports MariaDB (easily).

## TODO

* Create a better 404 page.
* Create a better UI for the user page.
* Allow users to delete all of their records on redir-loo.
* Load test this.
* Actually host this.
